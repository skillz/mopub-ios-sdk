/**
 A message to a @c MPProxy is forwarded to the target object, thus causes the proxy to transform itself
 into the target object. For unit testing, @c MPProxy is useful for injecting pre-action and post-action
 for a method call of any object without the need of creating a subclass to override the original
 implementation.

 @c MPProxy provides the @c forwardInvocation: and @c methodSignatureForSelector: methods defined
 in @c NSProxy to handle messages that it doesnâ€™t implement itself. Some @c NSObject methods are
 also implemented in order to transform the @MPProxy into the target object, such as @c superclass,
 @c isKindOfClass:, and @c isEqual:.

 The @c MPProxy implementation of @c forwardInvocation: triggers the pre-action and post-action, if
 registered. @MPProxy is also capable of counting how many times a selector has been called.

 Warning: @c MPProxy is not thread-safe. A typical issue is an @c XCTestExpectation being fulfilled
 in the pre-action or post-action is still alive after the unit test @c tearDown, and consequently
 causing the "waitForExpectations" logic confuses the unit test drivers and then failing the tests.
 To avoid unit test threading-safety issue, release the @c MPProxy object properly in @c tearDown.
